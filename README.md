        PLS restart awekend POE.

##   2) OPEN PATH OF EXILE IN STEAM
a)Create google docs and put it in editor mode for everyone.
b)Launch Path of Exile in Geforce Now, using your steam account (you can link steam to your path of exile account in case you don't already have this link)                  
c)Press Shift + Tab to open the steam overlay
Go to Settings -> Web Browser and change the home page to google docs link
d)Go to Settings -> In-Game and replace the steam overlay key to F7, this is what I used in my script, if for some reason you use this keybind for anything else, replace it in both the script, and the overlay hotkey to whatever you like.
